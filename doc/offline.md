# Offline system

The following files are part of the project:
- main_offline.py
- object_tracking.py
- face_tracking_gpu.py
- face_tracking.py
- gaze_behaviour.py

You can choose to use a GPU-based Deep Neural Network face recognition algorithm or a CPU-based Haar Cascade face recognition algorithm by selecting either:
**face_tracking_gpu.py** or **face_tracking.py** in main_offline. 

For the GPU-based option please follow the instructions in [install.md](install.md). For the CPU-based option follow the instructions in ...
